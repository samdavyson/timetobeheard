<img src="jane-steele-200.jpg" style="float:right" /><p>I have very extensive experience of helping people find ways of coping with life's difficulties. I have worked professionally for over 25 years as a counsellor, social worker, senior manager, antenatal and postnatal teacher. I have achieved high levels of academic learning as well as practice experience in each of these fields. I have also raised my own family and faced challenges to do with difficult early life experiences as well as continuing my own development through meeting on going life demands.
</p>
<p>I have a Diploma in Higher Education in Counselling (BACP accredited course), a Certificate in Counselling Skills, a Diploma in Social Work and a Masters in Applied Social Studies. I am an accredited CRUSE bereavement counsellor. I am a member of the <a href="http://www.bacp.co.uk/">British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy</a> I practise to high standards within its Ethical Framework. 
</p>
<p>I have worked for CRUSE (a bereavement service), MIND (a mental health charity), MENCAP (supporting those with a learning disability), Sheffield Alcohol Advisory Service, Parent Lifeline and the National Childbirth Trust (offering antenatal and postnatal classes). I also have wide experience as a social work manager and senior practitioner in hospital, child protection, children with disabilities, adoption and fostering settings.
</p>
<p>Clients have worked through issues to do with relationship problems, feelings of anxiety, panic and depression, self harm, eating disorders, bereavement (including loss of a child), miscarriage, abortion, suicide, child abuse, trauma, life threatening illnesses, alcohol and substance abuse, domestic violence, bullying, job stress and job loss, sexuality, adoption etc. There is nothing that is likely to shock or throw me after years of being with people at the sharp end of what life can and does throw at us! I have worked with men and women from all walks of life and of different ages, sexuality, religions and ethnicities.
