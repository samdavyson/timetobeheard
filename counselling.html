<P class="pagetitle">What is counselling?</P>
<div class="cushycms">
<p>Counselling offers a one to one confidential service with a trained professional, in a safe, caring, respectful and trusting setting, where you can share worries and distress and explore ways of dealing with your difficulties.
</p>
<p>As a counsellor I will bring my skills in listening, empathising, being non judgemental, analysing and making links as well as my experience in helping people make sense of their life and make changes if they wish. I have considerable knowledge of human development and difficulties that arise in that on going process and bring extensive experience of assisting others in coping with all that life can challenge us with.

</p>
<p>Counsellors do not usually offer advice but help the client find the right personal solutions for themselves.
